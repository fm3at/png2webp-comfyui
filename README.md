PNG to WEBP with ComfyUI Metadata Preservation

Convert ComfyUI created PNG files to WEBP while preserving ComfyUI metadata (prompt, workflow, extra_pnginfo). Supports drag & drop, recursive folder processing, and progress tracking. After conversion, original PNG files must be manually deleted by owner. Based on original ComfyUI code, with assistance from [Qwen-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct) LLM for development and refinement.
